  abstract = {Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Salmonidae) are foundational to social-\- ecological systems of the Northeast Pacific Rim and exhibit a rich diversity of life histories including in their adult migration timing, age at critical life-\-history transitions and marine feeding distributions. In recent decades Chinook have experienced declines across much of their native range; however, changes in productivity and abundance have rarely been evaluated in relation to life-h\- istory variation. To understand trends in Chinook salmon production, and how they are related to life history, we compiled time series data from the Fraser River to the Sacramento River on total run size (pre-\-fishery abundance) and escapement (post-\-fishery spawner abundance) and fit time series models to estimate trends across this bioregion. Our analysis revealed that most Chinook populations are declining, with negative trends in escapement (57 of 79) and total run (16 of 23) size. Trends were most acutely negative for interior spring Chinook in the Fraser, Columbia and Snake Rivers and most populations in California. Summer and fall Chinook had mixed trends, with several summer and fall upriver bright populations in the interior Columbia and Fraser exhibiting increases in abundance from the 1990s to 2019. Our research reveals widespread declines of this important species, but local complexity in trends that are mediated by population-\-level life history, migratory behaviours and watershed-\-scale restoration actions. Understanding linkages between life histories and resilience should inform rebuilding efforts for Chinook salmon and highlight the need to conserve intraspecific biodiversity.},

Variation at 13 microsatellite loci was surveyed for over 52,000 Chinook salmon sampled from over 320 localities ranging from Russia to California. The genetic differentiation index (FST) over all populations and loci was 0.063; individual locus values ranged from 0.026 to 0.130. The most genetically diverse Chinook salmon were observed from northern British Columbia, Washington (Puget Sound and coastal populations), and the upper Columbia River (spring run). Chinook salmon from the Alsek River, northern British Columbia, and the Klamath River, California, displayed the fewest number of alleles relative to Chinook salmon in other regions surveyed. Differentiation in Chinook salmon allele frequencies among river drainages and populations within river drainages was approximately 13 times greater than that of annual variation within populations. We observed a general pattern of regional structuring of populations, and Chinook salmon spawning in different tributaries within a major river drainage or in smaller rivers within a geographic area were generally more similar to each other than to populations in different major river drainages or geographic areas. Population structure of Chinook salmon on a Pacific Rim basis supports the concept of a minimum of two refuges, northern and southern, during the last glaciation. The distribution of microsatellite variation of Chinook salmon on a Pacific Rim basis reflects the origins of salmon radiating from refuges after the last glaciation period.},

GSI and PBT with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were applied in assessment of 2020 Chinook salmon fisheries and hatchery broodstocks in British Columbia (BC), Canada, with 9234 individuals successfully genotyped in fishery samples and 2250 PBT identifications made (24.4\% individual identification rate). As PBT identifications provided age of the individual and sex was determined from a SNP in the SNP panel, it was possible to evaluate sex ratios by age observed in the fishery sampling. Fishery catch sex ratios at age two and three years were male-biased, whereas those at age four and five years were female-biased. The combined age and sex information derived from genetics-based fishery sampling illustrates the ancillary information that becomes available relative to coded-wire tag (CWT) sampling if biological sampling of the catch is not conducted. There were 20,342 individuals genotyped in 65 hatchery broodstocks from which 6080 PBT identifications were made. Population-specific contributions to mixed-stock fisheries and exploitation rates were estimated with CWTs and GSI-PBT technologies for 13 populations, and close agreement of estimated population-specific exploitation rates between CWT and genetic methods for the 13 populations was observed (r2(11)= 0.951, P {$<$} 0.001). We conclude that a genetic approach can improve upon the results available from the current CWT program for assessment and management of Chinook salmon fisheries and hatchery broodstocks in BC, as well as provide ancillary information to improve wild Chinook salmon assessment and conservation by providing fishery impacts by conservation unit for any fishery in Canada.},

Known-origin and known-age age 1 juveniles from seven test populations were assigned via PBT (two parental genotypes required, 538 of 656 juveniles assigned; one parental genotype required, 636 of 656 juveniles assigned) with a minimum accuracy of 99.9\%.

A PBT--GSI or PBT system of identification may provide an alternate cost-effective method of identification in the assessment and conservation of Canadian-origin Chinook salmon relative to the existing CWT program, thereby providing very high resolution of mixed-stock fishery samples containing both hatchery-origin (adipose fin clipped) and wild-origin (unclipped) populations.},

Recent analyses have indicated that these fish (termed residents) comprise a substantial fraction of the Chinook salmon populations originating from Puget Sound rivers. However, the extent to which these resident salmon remain within their natal region or move within Puget Sound has not been studied. Analysis of two decades of coded-wire tagging data revealed several clear patterns. First, the salmon showed spatial distributions that varied systematically with area of origin. In general, they were caught in the vicinity of their origin, indicating limited net movement during several years at large; however this pattern was not universal. Second, recovery distributions were highly influenced by marine age and showed region specific spatial patterns, with the largest differences between the youngest (marine age 1) and oldest (marine age 4) individuals. {\copyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

To determine the degree to which changes in productivity are shared and to help identify environmental variables that might be related to those changes, we estimated the magnitude and spatial characteristics of positive correlations in productivity trends among stocks separated by various distances. We used Dynamic Factor Analysis to characterize shared time trends in productivity and found that these trends were most closely associated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and, to a lesser extent, with the location of the bifurcation in the North Pacific Current as it reaches North America's west coast. Chinook productivity patterns of separate populations have also become more synchronous in recent years, similar to results reported for other species of Pacific salmon. Such recent changes may reduce the resilience of the species to effects of climate change and habitat modification.},

  abstract = {Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of {$>$}2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.},

We use a large database of professional and crowd-sourced observations analyzed with hierarchical spline occupancy models to quantify seasonal variation in occurrence of an endangered apex predator, the southern resident killer whale (SRKW) Orcinus orca, in inland waters of the northeast Pacific Ocean. We find that timing of SRKW occurrence has shifted in their summer core habitat within the central Salish Sea: the day of year of peak occurrence probability shifted later at rates of 1-5 d yr-1 over 2001-2017 (resulting in shifts of 17-85 d across this 17 yr time period). These shifts are consistent with shifts in their preferred prey, Fraser River Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, as the relative number of fish returning to spawn in the spring has declined compared to numbers returning in summer and fall. The shift in timing of fall/winter SRKW occurrence outside the summer core habitat, however, is not consistent with shifts in other prey populations (Chinook, coho Oncorhynchus kisutch, chum Oncorhynchus keta salmon) returning to nearby rivers. Our findings demonstrate the complexity of consumer phenological responses and highlight gaps in our understanding of links between management actions that affect resource phenology and consequences for organisms relying on those resources.},

Three distinct ocean dispersal patterns were observed: (1) age-1 (yearling) mid and upper Columbia River spring-run and Snake River spring--summer-run Chinook Salmon migrated rapidly northward and by late summer were not found south of Vancouver Island; (2) age-0 (subyearling) lower Columbia River fall, upper Columbia River summer, upper Columbia River fall, and Snake River fall Chinook Salmon dispersed slowly, remaining mainly south of Vancouver Island through autumn; and (3) age-1 lower Columbia River spring, upper Columbia River summer, and upper Willamette River spring Chinook Salmon and Coho Salmon were widespread along the coast from summer through fall, indicating a diversity of dispersal rates. Generally, the ocean dispersal of age-1 fish was faster and more extensive than that of age-0 fish, with some age-1 fish migrating as fast as 10--40 km/d (0.5--3.0 body lengths/s).},

  abstract = {Resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) found in coastal waters of the cold-temperate northeastern Pacific are fish-feeding predators that specialize on Pacific salmon. Field studies have shown that although most available salmonids are consumed, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) is the whales' primary prey species, most likely because of its large size, high lipid content, and year-round occurrence in coastal waters. Chinook salmon availability appears to be important to the survival and recovery of resident killer whale populations. In this report we describe the results of recent field studies and analyses aimed at improving our understanding of the role played by Chinook salmon in the seasonal foraging ecology and energetics of resident killer whales. An additional 410 prey items identified from scale and tissue samples collected at the sites of resident feeding events provide further support for the importance of Chinook salmon in most seasons and coastal areas. Genetic stock identification of prey samples indicate that killer whales feed on Chinook salmon originating from a variety of regions between Southeast Alaska and Oregon, with stocks in the Fraser River system being of particular importance both coast-wide and in Critical Habitats. An updated analysis confirms the long-term correlation between survival of resident killer whales and range-wide Chinook abundance, though recent declines in Chinook abundance have not yet been associated with increased mortality rates. Estimates of Chinook salmon consumption based on daily prey energy requirements and diet composition suggest that resident killer whale populations at their current abundance may require over 1,000,000 Chinook per year, roughly equivalent to recent annual levels of harvests of this species in commercial and recreational marine fisheries. Estimates of Chinook salmon requirements for northern and southern resident killer whale populations in their Critical Habitats are also provided, as is an estimate of the Chinook abundance that would be required to support killer whale recovery over the next decade. Although the information in this report may be useful for future conservation and management of resident killer whales and their primary prey, further studies are needed to resolve existing uncertainties about year-round diet composition and feeding rates.},

  abstract = {Two forms of killer whale (Orcinus orca), resident and transient, occur sympatrically in coastal waters of British Columbia, Washington State, and southeastern Alaska. The two forms do not mix, and differ in seasonal distribution, social structure, and behaviour. These distinctions have been attributed to apparent differences in diet, although no comprehensive comparative analysis of the diets of the two forms had been undertaken. Here we present such an analysis, based on field observations of predation and on the stomach contents of stranded killer whales collected over a 20-year period. In total, 22 species of fish and 1 species of squid were documented in the diet of resident-type killer whales; 12 of these are previously unrecorded as prey of O. orca. Despite the diversity of fish species taken, resident whales have a clear preference for salmon prey. In field observations of feeding, 96\% of fish taken were salmonids. Six species of salmonids were identified from prey fragments, with chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) being the most common. The stomach contents of stranded residents also indicated a preference for chinook salmon. On rare occasions, resident whales were seen to harass marine mammals, but no kills were confirmed and no mammalian remains were found in the stomachs of stranded residents. Transient killer whales were observed to prey only on pinnipeds, cetaceans, and seabirds. Six mammal species were taken, with over half of observed attacks involving harbour seals (Phoca vitulina). Seabirds do not appear to represent a significant prey resource. This study thus reveals the existence of strikingly divergent prey preferences of resident and transient killer whales, which are reflected in distinctive foraging strategies and related sociobiological traits of these sympatric populations.},

Although the possible top-down effects of killer whale predation on populations of their prey have received much recent attention, little is known of how the abundance of these predators may be limited by bottom-up processes. Here we show, using 25 years of demographic data from two populations of fish-eating killer whales in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, that population trends are driven largely by changes in survival, and that survival rates are strongly correlated with the availability of their principal prey species, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Our results suggest that, although these killer whales may consume a variety of fish species, they are highly specialized and dependent on this single salmonid species to an extent that it is a limiting factor in their population dynamics. Other ecologically specialized killer whale populations may be similarly constrained to a narrow range of prey species by culturally inherited foraging strategies, and thus are limited in their ability to adapt rapidly to changing prey availability.},

Different ecotypic forms of the species, which often exist in sympatry, may have distinct foraging specialisations. One form found in coastal waters of the temperate NE Pacific Ocean, known as the `resident' ecotype, feeds predominantly on salmonid prey. An earlier study that used opportunistic collection of prey remains from kill sites as an indicator of predation rates suggested that resident killer whales may forage selectively for chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, the largest but one of the least abundant Pacific salmon species. Potential biases in the prey fragment sampling technique, however, made the validity of this finding uncertain. We under- took field studies of foraging behaviour of resident killer whales to resolve this uncertainty and to examine potential variation in prey selection by season, geographical area, group membership and prey availability. Foraging by resident killer whales was found to frequently involve sharing by 2 or more whales. Prey fragments left at kill sites resulted mostly from handling and breaking up of prey for sharing, and all species and sizes of salmonids were shared. Resident killer whale groups in all parts of the study area foraged selectively for chinook salmon, probably because of the species' large size, high lipid content, and year-round availability in the whales' range. Chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta, the second largest salmonid, were also taken when available, but smaller sock- eye O. nerka and pink O. gorbuscha salmon were not significant prey despite far greater seasonal abundance. Strong selectivity for chinook salmon by resident killer whales probably has a significant influence on foraging tactics and seasonal movements, and also may have important implications for the conservation and management of both predator and prey.},

An example, and our motivation, is the weight of a given fish species in a fish trawl. The analysis task is complicated by the occurrence of exactly zero observations. It makes many statistical methods for continuous data inappropriate. In this paper we propose a model that extends a Tweedie generalised linear model. The proposed model exploits the fact that a Tweedie distribution is equivalent to the distribution obtained by summing a Poisson number of gamma random variables. In the proposed model, both the number of gamma variates, and their average size, are modelled separately. The model has a composite link and has a flexible mean-variance relationship that can vary with covariates. We illustrate the model, and compare it to other models, using data from a fish trawl survey in south-east Australia.},

Although variation in vertical distributions among individuals provides evidence of habitat selection, it has been challenging to disentangle how processes at multiple spatio-temporal scales shape behaviour. Methods{\enspace} We collected thousands of observations of depth from {$>$} 300 acoustically tagged adult Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, spanning multiple seasons and years. We used these data to parameterize a machine-learning model to disentangle the influence of spatial, temporal, and dynamic oceanographic variables while accounting for differences in individual condition and maturation stage. Results{\enspace} The top performing machine learning model used bathymetric depth ratio (i.e., individual depth relative to seafloor depth) as a response. We found that bathymetry, season, maturation stage, and spatial location most strongly influenced Chinook salmon depth. Chinook salmon bathymetric depth ratios were deepest in shallow water, during winter, and for immature individuals. We also identified non-linear interactions among covariates, resulting in spatially-varying effects of zooplankton concentration, lunar cycle, temperature and oxygen concentration. Conclusions{\enspace} Our results suggest Chinook salmon vertical habitat use is a function of ecological interactions, not physiological constraints. Temporal and spatial variation in depth distributions could be used to guide management decisions intended to reduce fishery impacts on Chinook salmon. More generally, our findings demonstrate how complex interactions among bathymetry, seasonality, location, and life history stage regulate vertical habitat selection.},

  abstract = {Population-specific spatial and temporal distribution data are necessary to identify mechanisms regulating abundance and to manage anthropogenic impacts. However the distributions of highly migratory species are often difficult to resolve, particularly when multiple populations' movements overlap. Here we present an integrated model to estimate spatially-stratified, seasonal trends in abundance and population composition, using data from extensive genetic sampling of commercial and recreational Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fisheries in southern British Columbia. We use the model to estimate seasonal changes in population-specific standardized catch per unit effort (a proxy for abundance) across six marine regions, while accounting for annual variability in sampling effort and uncertain genetic stock assignment. We also share this model as an R package stockseasonr for application to other regions and species. Even at the relatively small spatial scales considered here, we found that patterns in seasonal abundance differed among regions and stocks. While certain locations were clearly migratory corridors, regions within the Salish Sea exhibited diverse, and often weak, seasonal patterns in abundance, emphasizing that they are important, year-round foraging habitats. Furthermore, we found evidence that stocks with similar freshwater life histories and adult run timing, as well as relatively proximate spawning locations, exhibited divergent distributions. Our findings highlight subtle, but important differences in how adult Chinook salmon use marine habitats. Down-scaled model outputs could be used to inform ecosystem-based management efforts by resolving the degree to which salmon overlap with other species of concern, as well as specific fisheries. More broadly, variation in stock-specific abundance among regions indicates efforts to identify mechanisms driving changes in size-at-maturity and natural mortality should account for distinct marine distributions.},

We found that juvenile marine distribution------rather than freshwater life history, run timing, or adult marine distribution------was the best predictor of trends in both survival and age. Only subyearling stocks that enter the Strait of Georgia showed evidence of transitioning to a low juvenile survival period, other groupings exhibited low and stable or cyclical patterns in survival.

  abstract = {Understanding diet is critical for conservation of endangered predators. Southern Resident killer whales (SRKW) (Orcinus orca) are an endangered population occurring primarily along the outer coast and inland waters of Washington and British Columbia. Insufficient prey has been identified as a factor limiting their recovery, so a clear understanding of their seasonal diet is a high conservation priority. Previous studies have shown that their summer diet in inland waters consists primarily of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), despite that species' rarity compared to some other salmonids. During other times of the year, when occurrence patterns include other portions of their range, their diet remains largely unknown. To address this data gap, we collected feces and prey remains from October to May 2004--2017 in both the Salish Sea and outer coast waters. Using visual and genetic species identification for prey remains and genetic approaches for fecal samples, we characterized the diet of the SRKWs in fall, winter, and spring. Chinook salmon were identified as an important prey item yearround, averaging {\textasciitilde}50\% of their diet in the fall, increasing to 70--80\% in the mid-winter/ early spring, and increasing to nearly 100\% in the spring. Other salmon species and nonsalmonid fishes, also made substantial dietary contributions. The relatively high species diversity in winter suggested a possible lack of Chinook salmon, probably due to seasonally lower densities, based on SRKW's proclivity to selectively consume this species in other seasons. A wide diversity of Chinook salmon stocks were consumed, many of which are also at risk. Although outer coast Chinook samples included 14 stocks, four rivers systems accounted for over 90\% of samples, predominantly the Columbia River.},

  abstract = {Accurate knowledge of behavior is necessary to effectively manage the effects of human activities on wildlife, including vessel-based whale-watching. Yet, the wholly aquatic nature of cetaceans makes understanding their basic behavioral ecology quite challenging. An endangered population of killer whales faces several identified threats including prey availability and disturbance from vessels and sound. We used bio-logging tags that were temporally attached to individuals of the endangered Southern Resident killer whale population to more fully understand their subsurface behavior and to investigate vessel effects on behavior, including foraging behavior involving prey capture. We collected tag data over three field seasons in the waters surrounding the San Juan Islands, WA, United States, corresponding to the core summer area of the critical habitat of the population. Here, we used hidden Markov models to identify latent behavioral states that include characterization of different foraging states from sound and movement variables recorded by the multi-sensor tags. We tested a number of vessel variables (e.g., vessel counts, distance, and speed) on state transition probabilities, state occurrence and time spent within each behavioral state. Whales made fewer dives involving prey capture and spent less time in these dives when vessels had an average distance less than 400 yd (366 m). Additionally, we found both a sex and vessel distance effect on the state transition probabilities, suggesting that females and males respond differently to nearby vessels. Specifically, females were more likely to transition to a non-foraging state when vessels had an average distance less than 400 yd (366 m). A female's decision to forego foraging states due to the close proximity of vessels could have cascading effects on the ability to meet energetic requirements to support reproductive efforts. This is particularly concerning in an endangered population that is in decline. Our findings, suggesting that female killer whales are at greater risk to close approaches by vessels, highlight the importance of understanding sex-specific responses to disturbance. These findings can inform future management decisions seeking to preserve foraging opportunities and enhance recovery efforts relevant to many cetacean species, including vulnerable and endangered populations.},

However, we often have a limited understanding of vessel impacts on marine wildlife, particularly cetaceans, due to challenges of studying fully-aquatic species. To investigate vessel and acoustic effects on cetacean foraging behavior, we attached suction-cup sound and movement tags to endangered Southern Resident killer whales in their summer habitat while collecting georeferenced proximate vessel data. We identified prey capture dives using whale kinematic signatures and found that the probability of capturing prey increased as salmon abundance increased, but decreased as vessel speed increased. When vessels emitted navigational sonar, whales made longer dives to capture prey and descended more slowly when they initiated these dives. Finally, whales descended more quickly when noise levels were higher and vessel approaches were closer. These findings advance a growing understanding of vessel and sound impacts on marine wildlife and inform efforts to manage vessel impacts on endangered populations.},

Analyses of proportional data are challenged by categories with zero observations (zeros), all observations (ones), and overdispersion. In lieu of ad hoc data adjustments, we describe and evaluate a zero-and-one inflated Dirichlet regression model, with its corresponding R package (zoid), capable of handling observed data x consisting of three possible categories: zeros, proportions, or ones. Instead of fitting the model to observations of single biological units (e.g., individual organisms) within a sample, we sum proportional contributions across units and estimate mixture proportions using one aggregated observation per sample. Optional estimation of overdispersion and covariate influences expand model applications. We evaluate model performance, as implemented in Stan, using simulations and two ecological case studies. We show that zoid successfully estimates mixture proportions using simulated data with varying sample sizes and is robust to overdispersion and covariate structure. In empirical case studies, we estimate the composition of a mixed-stock Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fishery and analyze the stomach contents of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Our implementation of the model as an R package facilitates its application to varied ecological data sets composed of proportional observations.},

Chinook salmon (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 5,886) were collected at Bonneville Dam during August--October over 7 years. We selected for upriver bright (URB) populations en route to interior basin spawning sites because these groups are priority populations for both fisheries and conservation efforts. Run composition varied within and among years, but in all years a relatively large percentage of the earliest migrants returned to upper Columbia River sites and the majority of late-run fish returned to the Columbia River Hanford Reach. Deschutes, Yakima, and Snake River populations typically constituted small ( 17\%) but relatively constant proportions of the run throughout each migration season. Population-specific migration timing distributions indicated modest but persistent timing differences among populations, particularly for Hanford Reach and upper Columbia River populations. Annual reported reservoir harvest estimates ranged from 12\% to 26\%. Harvest rates varied seasonally within years, from relatively low mean rates ( 11\%) for fish tagged early and late in migrations to peak rates of over 25\% for those tagged in late August and early September. These patterns suggest that it may be possible to increase harvest of abundant populations and reduce harvest of some vulnerable populations by adjusting the timing of fisheries. In addition, there was evidence that larger fish were harvested at higher rates and that mean fish size differed among populations. The combined results improve our understanding of the Columbia River URB fall Chinook salmon run and should help in refining harvest and escapement management plans.},

The causal agents underpinning these shifts are largely unknown. Here we investigate the potential role of late-stage marine mortality, defined as occurring after the first winter at sea, in driving this species' changing age structure. Simulations using a stage-based life cycle model that included additional mortality during after the first winter at sea better reflected observed changes in the age structure of a well-studied and representative population of Chinook salmon from the Yukon River drainage, compared with a model estimating environmentally-driven variation in age-specific survival alone. Although the specific agents of late-stage mortality are not known, our finding is consistent with work reporting predation by salmon sharks (               Lamna ditropis               ) and marine mammals including killer whales (               Orcinus orca               ). Taken as a whole, this work suggests that Pacific salmon mortality after the first winter at sea is likely to be higher than previously thought and highlights the need to investigate selective sources of mortality, such as predation, as major contributors to rapidly changing age structure of spawning adult Chinook salmon.},

The concepts outlined here are intended to serve as the basis for a general approach to performing salmonid conservation assessments. Pacific salmonid risk evaluations can occur at small, local scales or over larger geographic regions--- depending on the salmon management entities involved and the purpose of the risk assessment. In this document, we focus on conservation assessments of salmonid populations and Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) because there is an immediate need for such evaluations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)---a concern that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) must address. This document is divided into two main sections: 1) an initial discussion of the general concepts underlying the notion of a VSP, and 2) a detailed appendix where we provide technical details to support population identification, population parameter guidelines, and specific examples of how the guidelines pertain to salmonids. We have confidence in the conceptual foundations underlying both the notion of a VSP and what critical elements should be evaluated when determining viability at the population and ESU scales. However, the approach to applying the VSP concept itself is still in the development stage and is likely to change with experience. We expect that the means of identifying population boundaries and establishing guidelines for population parameters will continue to be refined as further empirical data and modeling efforts are brought to bear on these important issues.

This is particularly true for Chinook salmon               Oncorhynchus tshawytscha               , a species exhibiting a wide range of life histories across stocks. This has led to continuing questions regarding the accuracy of scale-based age determination for Chinook salmon. This study assessed the accuracy of Chinook salmon scale age data produced by multiple readers from multiple agencies, who aged hatchery fish of known age from mixed-stock, nonterminal fisheries conducted along the Pacific coast of Canada from 1991 to 2003. The test sample consisted of scales from 434 fish from both stream- and ocean-type stocks marked with coded wire tags (i.e., fish origin and total age were known). Sample stocks originated from Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Five readers from three federal or state Pacific Northwest fisheries agencies participated in the study. The readers possessed various levels of experience, which was classified as (1) deep or shallow (depth) depending on the number of years the reader was involved in aging Chinook salmon scales and (2) broad or narrow (breadth) depending on the variety of stocks the reader had previously encountered. Accuracy ranged from 84\% to 94\%, although readers with both deep and broad experience consistently achieved accuracies greater than 90\%, while those with a narrower breadth of experience tended to show age bias. Overall, the results suggest that aging Chinook salmon scales from ocean-caught hatchery fish can be accurate and that readers' previous exposure to stocks comprising a wide range of life history types may be at least as important as the number of years of experience in achieving a high level of aging accuracy.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Effective conservation of threatened populations requires identification of the processes limiting recovery. When multiple population processes are potentially limiting, they are sometimes analyzed independently, often using different datasets. Analytically, this is suboptimal, as processes are often correlated, which can lead to biased estimates of parameters and quantities of interest. Integrated population models (IPMs) can synthesize several data streams in the same probabilistic framework to circumvent these issues. Lack of prey was identified as one of the primary threats to recovery of critically endangered southern resident killer whales (SRKWs),               Orcinus orca               . Previous studies have correlated SRKW demographic rates with indices of Chinook salmon               Oncorhynchus tshawytscha               abundance, but these approaches have modeled reproduction and survival independently. We developed an IPM for SRKWs that models both processes simultaneously, as a function of Chinook salmon abundance along the west coast of North America. We used this model to evaluate the relationship between Chinook salmon abundance and demographic rates of SRKWs, with the goal of updating our understanding of a potential causal relationship between prey availability and SRKW population dynamics, and how these relationships may have changed over time. Results suggest that SRKW mortality rates are more strongly associated with Chinook salmon abundance than birth rates. Our analysis also suggests northern resident killer whale abundance could also be affecting SRKW carrying capacity, possibly through competition over shared prey resources. The IPM fit observed total abundance data well and predicted temporal changes in population demographics with reasonable accuracy, but small sample size may have opacified model selection. Our approach offers a valuable tool for predicting the response of the SRKW population to alternative management strategies involving the recovery of Chinook salmon stocks in the eastern Pacific.},

  abstract = {Recovery of depleted species is difficult, but it can be especially complex when the target species interacts strongly with other depleted species. Such is the case for northern and southern resident killer whales Orcinus orca which are listed as `endangered' under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Canada's Species at Risk Act. These resident killer whales prey heavily on Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., including several `evolutionarily significant units' also listed under the ESA. In response to concerns that a depleted prey base may affect killer whale recovery, we analyzed proximate composition and calculated caloric content of Pacific salmon to evaluate the importance of salmon species, population, body size, and lipid levels in determining their energy content as prey for killer whales. We sampled all 5 species of Pacific salmon, but emphasized Chinook salmon, a predominant prey of killer whales. Energy density (kcal kg-1) was highly correlated with lipid content, whereas total energy value (kcal fish-1) was determined primarily by fish mass and secondarily by lipid content. These salmon energetics data can be used to provide better precision and estimates on the caloric value of prey to killer whales. To facilitate application of these results to the co-management of salmon and killer whales, we produced a simple relationship that uses fish length to predict total energy of Chinook salmon as prey where population-specific energy densities and fish masses are lacking. Benefits to killer whales from possible salmon fishery closures, or other activities that affect prey availability, will depend on the salmon species and populations involved.

  abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels and the factors affecting PCB accumulation in subadult and maturing Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from Puget Sound were characterized. Specifically, we (1) determined PCB levels in Chinook salmon from Puget Sound and compared them with levels in Chinook salmon from other West Coast populations, (2) determined whether PCB accumulation mainly occurred in the freshwater or marine habitats, and (3) quantified the relative importance of fish age, fish size (fork length), lipid content, and saltwater age (the number of winters spent in saltwater) on PCB concentration. The average PCB concentration measured in skinless muscle tissue samples of subadult and maturing Chinook salmon collected from Puget Sound was 53 ng/g (wet weight), which was 3-5 times higher than those measured in six other populations of Chinook salmon on the West Coast of North America. Concentrations in the Puget Sound samples varied from 10 to 220 ng/g. A comparison of PCB body burdens between subyearling smolts and returning adults revealed that almost all of the PCBs (.96\%) were accumulated in the marine habitats. Surprisingly, although PCBs were mostly accumulated in marine habitats, PCB exposure was lowest in the largest fish that spent the most time in saltwater. Collectively, saltwater age, fish size, and lipids only accounted for 37\% of the observed variation in PCB concentration, indicating that some other attribute of the fish's marine ecology accounted for the variation in PCB levels among Puget Sound Chinook salmon and for their elevated PCB levels relative to other West Coast populations. We hypothesized that residency in the contaminated Puget Sound environment was a major factor contributing to the higher and more variable PCB concentrations in these fish. This hypothesis was supported with an independent data set from a fishery assessment model, which estimated that 29\% of subyearling Chinook salmon and 45\% of yearling out-migrants from Puget Sound displayed resident behavior. {\copyright} American Fisheries Society 2009.},

To identify population-specific migration time and to index abundance, we analyzed 4,822 fish sampled for genetic variation in 2000 and 2001 and 580 fish with coded wire tags (CWTs) caught from 1987 to 2004 in a test fishery near the river mouth. Population sizes estimated from microsatellite variation were within 3.4\% of the known-origin population composition and were unbiased in comparison with known-origin population sizes. All but 1 of the 30 populations detected by both genetic methods and CWTs had overlapping migration times, but these times differed significantly for only 7 populations. Migration times were identified for another 23 untagged populations identified by using genetics, which resulted in the assignment of migration timing groups (peak passage) for 53 populations as spring (March-May), early summer (June), midsummer (July), late summer (August), and fall (September-October). Population abundance indices at the test fishery were significantly associated with run size at the river mouth. When populations were aggregated by geographic stock structure and migration time, the abundance indices for the test fishery explained 80\% of the variation in run size. Incorporating genetic information can substantially improve the utility of test fishery data and thereby allow more-precise management of complex population aggregates such as those in the Fraser River. {\copyright} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2008.},

  abstract = {Monitoring and assessment of natural resources often require inputs from multiple data sources. In fisheries science, for example, the inference of a species' abundance distribution relies on two main data sources, namely commercial fisheries and scientific survey data. Despite efforts to combine these data into an integrated statistical model, their coupling is frequently hampered due to differences in their sampling designs, which imposes distinct bias sources in the estimator of the abundance distribution. We developed a flexible species distribution model (SDM) that can integrate both data sources while filtering out their relative bias contributions. We applied the model on three different age groups of the western Baltic cod stock. For each age group, we tested the model on (1) survey data and (2) integrated data (survey + commercial) as a means to compare their differences and investigate how the inclusion of commercial fisheries data improved the spatiotemporal abundance estimator and parameter estimates. Moreover, we proposed a novel validation approach to evaluate whether the inclusion of commercial fisheries data in the integrated model is not in direct contradiction with the survey data. Following our approach, the results indicated that the use of commercial fisheries data is suitable for the integrated model. Across all age groups, our results demonstrated how commercial fisheries supplied additional information on cod's spatiotemporal abundance dynamics, highlighting sometimes abundance hot spots that were not detected by the survey model alone. Additionally, the integrated model provided a reduction of up to 20\% and 10\% in the uncertainty (SE) of the predicted abundance fields and fixed-effect parameters, respectively. The proposed model represents thus a valuable benchmark for evaluating spatiotemporal dynamics of fish, and strengthens the science-based advice for marine policymakers.},

  abstract = {Identifying factors that influence anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) population dynamics is complicated by their diverse life histories and large geographic range. Over the last several decades, Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) populations from coastal areas and the Salish Sea have exhibited substantial variability in abundance. In some cases, populations within the Salish Sea have experienced persistent declines that have not rebounded. We analyzed a time series of early marine survival from 36 hatchery Chinook salmon populations spanning ocean entry years 1980--2008 to quantify spatial and temporal coherence in survival. Overall, we observed higher inter-population variability in survival for Salish Sea populations than non-Salish Sea populations. Annual survival patterns of Salish Sea populations covaried over smaller spatial scales and exhibited less synchrony among proximate populations relative to non-Salish Sea populations. These results were supported by multivariate autoregressive state space (MARSS) models which predominantly identified region-scale differences in survival trends between northern coastal, southern coastal, Strait of Georgia, and Puget Sound population groupings. Furthermore, Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) of regional survival trends showed that survival of southern coastal populations was associated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, a large-scale ocean circulation pattern, whereas survival of Salish Sea populations was not. In summary, this study demonstrates that survival patterns in Chinook salmon are likely determined by a complex hierarchy of processes operating across a broad range in spatial and temporal scales, presenting challenges to the management of mixed-stock fisheries.},

However, in-situ data on the availability of their preferred prey (Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the core feeding areas used by these two populations of fish-eating killer whales have been lacking to test this hypothesis. We used multi-frequency echosounders (38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz) to estimate densities of adult Chinook (age-4+, {$>$} 81 cm) within 16 hot-spot feeding areas used by resident killer whales during summer 2020 in the Salish Sea and North Island Waters. We found Chinook were generally concentrated within 50 m from the bottom in the deep waters, and tended to be absent near the surface in the shallow waters ({$<$} 50 m). In general, the densities of Chinook we encountered were highest as the fish entered the Salish Sea (from Swiftsure Bank in the south) and Johnstone Strait (from Queen Charlotte Strait to the north)---and declined as fish migrated eastward along the shoreline of Vancouver Island. Median densities of Chinook for all sampled areas combined were 0.4 ind.{\dbend}1000 m-2 in northern resident foraging areas, and 0.9 ind.{\dbend}1000 m-2 in southern resident killer whale areas (p {$<$} 0.05, Mann--Whitney U test). Thus, Chinook salmon were twice as prevalent within the hot-spot feeding areas of southern versus northern resident killer whales. This implies that southern resident killer whales have greater access to Chinook salmon compared to northern residents during summer---and that any food shortage southern residents may be encountering is occurring at other times of year, or elsewhere in their range.},

We incorporate recoveries from multiple ocean fisheries and allow for regional variation in fisheries vulnerability and maturation. We show that Chinook salmon ocean distribution depends strongly on region of origin and varies seasonally while survival showed regionally varying temporal patterns. Simulations incorporating juvenile production data provide proportional stock composition in different ocean regions and the first coastwide projections of Chinook salmon aggregate abundance. Our model provides an extendable framework that can be applied to understand drivers of Chinook salmon biology (e.g. climate effects on ocean distribution) and management effects (e.g. consequences of juvenile production changes).},

  abstract = {Recovering small, endangered populations is challenging, especially if the drivers of declines are not well understood. While infrequent births and deaths may be important to the outlook of endangered populations, small sample sizes confound studies seeking the mechanisms underlying demographic fluctuations. Individual metrics of health, such as nutritive condition, can provide a rich data source on population status and may translate into population trends. We examined interannual changes in body condition metrics of endangered Southern Resident killer whales (SRKW) collected using helicopters and remotely operated drones. We imaged and measured the condition of the majority of all three social pods (J, K, and L) in each of seven years between 2008 and 2019. We used Bayesian multi-state transition models to identify relationships between body condition changes and both tributary-specific and area-based indices of Chinook salmon abundance, and K-fold cross-validation to compare the predictive power of candidate salmon covariates. We found that Fraser River (tributary-specific) and Salish Sea (area-based) Chinook salmon abundances had the greatest predictive power for J Pod body condition changes, as well as the strongest relationships between any salmon covariates and SRKW condition across pods. Puget Sound (tributary-specific) Chinook salmon abundance had the greatest predictive power for L Pod body condition changes, but a weaker relationship than Fraser River or Salish Sea abundance had with J Pod body condition. The best-fit model for K Pod included no Chinook covariates. In addition, we found elevated mortality probabilities in SRKW exhibiting poor body condition (reflecting depleted fat reserves), 2--3 times higher than whales in more robust condition. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that (1) fluctuations in SRKW body condition can in some cases be linked to Chinook salmon abundance; (2) the three SRKW pods appear to have distinct patterns of body condition fluctuations, suggesting different foraging patterns; and (3) aerial photogrammetry is a useful early-warning system that can identify SRKW at higher risk of mortality in the near future.},

We used 17 years of sightings data from the SRKW core summer habitat in the Salish Sea to examine trends in presence of SRKW, and how these trends may be related to the availability of a key food source, Fraser River-origin Chinook salmon. We found that SRKW occupancy has declined by more than 75\%, in step with reduced average catch per unit effort (CPUE) of Fraser River Chinook salmon. J pod was present in the core summer habitat most often, followed by K and L pods. All three pods demonstrated declines in visitation to the core summer habitat from 2004 to 2020, and presence of SRKW was significantly related to annual average Fraser Chinook CPUE. Our findings suggest that declining Fraser River Chinook returns may be reaching a point where SRKW cannot reliably meet their energetic needs, driving them to forage in areas outside of their traditional core summer habitat.},

  abstract = {Conservation management planning for highly mobile species requires an understanding of the distribution of areas that are biologically important to the species of concern. Collecting data on the locations of animal behaviors linked to biological characteristics, such as foraging, can be used to spatially describe biological important areas. However, spatial modeling of free-ranging animal behavior can be challenging, as behavioral observations of animals are often clustered, and sampling is commonly conducted at a higher frequency than changes in behavioral states, resulting in data that are usually highly autocorrelated in space and time. Here, we fit latent Gaussian process models to observational behavioral data to generate spatially-explicit pre\- dictions of foraging behavior within the critical habitat of an endangered population of fisheating killer whales (Orcinus orca) in southern British Columbia, Canada, and northern Wash\- ington State, USA. We compare spatial models treating temporal autocorrelation in behavior in three ways: (1) ignoring temporal autocorrelation entirely; (2) traditional data-thinning to remove temporal autocorrelation, and; (3) using a temporal Gaussian process to account for temporal autocorrelation. Comparisons of autocorrelative structures for each model and visual comparison of broad spatial patterns demonstrate that our third approach yields more accurate results than when ignoring temporal autocorrelation entirely and higher precision results than when applying data-thinning methods. Within the identified areas of critical habitat, our models indicate two primary regions of intense killer whale foraging activity, and we delineate areas wherein the probability of foraging was particularly high as candidate locations for conservation management actions. This study underscores the value of refining our understanding of high-use areas for at-risk species by incorporating animal behavior data to inform area-based conservation measures.},

Samples are often treated as compositional data, where each prey is analyzed as a continuous percentage of the total. However, analyzing compositional data results in analytical challenges, for example, highly parameterized models or prior transformation of data. Here, we present a novel approximation involving a Tweedie generalized linear model (GLM). We first review how this approximation emerges from considering predator foraging as a thinned and marked point process (with marks representing prey species and individual prey size). This derivation can motivate future theoretical and applied developments. We then provide a practical tutorial for the Tweedie GLM using new package mvtweedie that extends capabilities of widely used packages in R (mgcv and ggplot2) by transforming output to calculate prey compositions. We demonstrate this approach and software using two examples.

  abstract = {Weighting data appropriately in stock assessment models is necessary to diagnose model mis-specification, estimate uncertainty, and when combining data sets. Age- and length-composition data are often fitted using a multinomial distribution and then reweighted iteratively, and the Dirichlet-multinomial (``DM'') likelihood provides a model-based alternative that estimates an additional parameter and thereby ``self-weights'' data. However, the DM likelihood requires specifying an input sample size (ninput), which is often unavailable and results are sensitive to ninput. We therefore introduce the multivariate-Tweedie (MVTW) as alternative with three benefits: (1) it can identify both overdispersion (downweighting) or underdispersion (upweighting) relative to the ninput; (2) proportional changes in ninput are exactly offset by parameters; and (3) it arises naturally when expanding data arising from a hierarchical sampling design. We use an age-structured simulation to show that the MVTW (1) can be more precise than the DM in estimating data weights, and (2) can appropriately upweight data when needed. We then use a real-world state-space assessment to show that the MVTW can easily be adapted to other software. We recommend that stock assessments explore the sensitivity to specifying DM, MVTW, and logistic-normal likelihoods, particularly when the DM estimates an effective sample size approaching ninput.},

Frequencies with which particular prey species occur among collections of scats are easily compiled to describe the average diet, and can be used to compare diets between and within geographic regions, and across years and seasons. Important to these analyses is the question of statistical power. In other words, how many scats should be collected to compare the diet among and between species? We addressed this problem by using Monte Carlo simulations and frequency of occurrence methods to analytically determine the consequence of sample size on the dietary analysis of scats. We considered 2 questions. First, how is the statistical power affected by sample size? Second, what is the likelihood of not identifying a prey species? We randomly sampled predetermined numbers of scats (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 10--200) from computer-generated populations of scats containing prey of known species and frequencies of occurrences. We also randomly sampled a large database of field-collected scats from Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus). We then used standard contingency table tests such as chi-square and Fisher's exact test to determine whether differences between our samples and populations were statistically significant. We found that a minimum size of 59 scats is necessary to identify principal prey remains occurring in .5\% of scats. However, 94 samples are required when comparing diets to distinguish moderate effect sizes over time or between areas. These findings have significant implications for the interpretation of published dietary data, as well as for the design of future scat-based dietary studies for pinnipeds and other species.},

Here we contrast the abundance, distribution and seasonal stock compositions of juvenile Chinook salmon between years in 3 oceanographic regions of the Pacific from southern British Columbia to southeast Alaska. Between 1998 and 2008, we surveyed salmon in various months from June through March, in different regions along the shelf. Variable conditions in the North Pacific Ocean, as well as large overall shifts in ocean regimes were extensively documented over this decade. We employed genetic stock identification to identify mixed-stock compositions; fish (n = 6274) were allocated to one of 15 regional and 40 subregional stocks. Catch-per-unit-effort and distribution of salmon, as denoted by centre of mass, varied significantly between seasons, regions and years. In a similar manner, fish body size and dryweight varied significantly between years, seasons and regions. Despite these inter-annual differences in catch, distribution, fish growth performance and large variations in ocean conditions encountered by salmon over the time period of the study, we observed no response in terms of shifts in stock-specific distributions. Regional stock composition was similar between years, suggesting migration patterns for all stocks remain consistent despite fluctuations in the marine environment: local stocks remain resident in respective coastal areas during their first year at sea, except for Columbia River salmon, which move quickly into waters north of Vancouver Island in summer.},

When these species are also endangered, conservation efforts require management strategies based on a comprehensive understanding of the variability in these behaviours. In the northeast Pacific Ocean, three partially sympatric populations of resident killer whales occupy coastal ecosystems from California to Alaska. One population (southern resident killer whales) is endangered, while another (southern Alaska resident killer whales) has exhibited positive abundance trends for the last several decades. Using 185 faecal samples collected from both populations between 2011 and 2021, we compare variability in diet preference to provide insight into differences in foraging patterns that may be linked with the relative success and decline of these populations. We find broad similarities in the diet of the two populations, with differences arising from spatiotemporal and social variability in resource use patterns, especially in the timing of shifts between target prey species. The results described here highlight the importance of comprehensive longitudinal monitoring of foraging ecology to inform management strategies for endangered, highly social top marine predators.},

  abstract = {1. Management decisions for threatened and endangered species require risks to be identified and prioritized, based on the degree to which they influence population dynamics. The potential for recovery of small populations at risk may be determined by multiple factors, including intrinsic population characteristics (inbreeding, sex ratios) and extrinsic variables (prey availability, disease, human disturbance). Using Bayesian statistical methods, the impact of each of these risk factors on demographic rates can be quantified and assigned probabilities to express uncertainty. 2. We assessed the impact of a wide range of factors on the fecundity of two threatened populations of killer whales Orcinus orca, specifically whether killer whale production is limited by availability of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. Additional variables included anthropogenic factors, climate variables, temporal effects, and population variables (population size, number of males, female age). 3. Our results indicate that killer whale fecundity is highly correlated with the abundance of Chinook salmon. For example, the probability of a female calving differed by 50\% between years of low salmon abundance and high salmon abundance. Weak evidence exists for linking fecundity to other variables, such as sea surface temperature. 4. There was strong data support for reproductive senescence in female killer whales. This pattern of rapid maturity and gradual decline of fecundity with age commonly seen in terrestrial mammals has been documented in few marine mammal species. Maximum production for this species occurs between ages 20-22, and reproductive performance declines gradually to menopause over a period of 25 years. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide strong evidence for reproductive senescence in killer whales, and more importantly, that killer whale fecundity is strongly tied to the abundance of Chinook salmon, a species that is susceptible to environmental variation and has high commercial value to fisheries. This strong predator-prey relationship highlights the importance of understanding which salmon populations overlap with killer whales seasonally and spatially, so that those salmon populations important as prey for killer whales can be identified and targeted for conservation efforts. {\copyright} 2008 British Ecological Society.},

I used this data set to examine the spatial and temporal variation in the marine distributions of 77 hatchery and 16 wild populations of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha based on recoveries of an estimated 632,000 tagged salmon in coastal waters from southern California to the Bering Sea during 1979--1994 (and 1995--2004 for select hatcheries). Chinook salmon showed 12 distinct region-specific recovery patterns. Chinook salmon originating in a common freshwater region had similar marine distributions, which were distinct from those of adjacent regions. Different run types (e.g., spring, summer, and fall runs) originating in the same region exhibited variation in their marine distributions consistent with recovery at different stages of their ocean residence period. Recovery patterns were surprisingly stable across years, despite high interannual variation in ocean conditions. By contrast, ocean age influenced recovery patterns, as older fish were recovered further from their natal stream than younger fish. Although most of the CWT data used in the analysis came from hatchery fish, recoveries of tagged wild populations indicate patterns similar to those of fish from nearby hatcheries. The consistency in these findings across broad geographic areas suggests that they apply to Chinook salmon across the entire Pacific Rim. Similar findings for tagged coho salmon O. kisutch indicate that the observed patterns may apply to Pacific salmon as a whole and provide a model for other highly migratory fishes that have not benefited from such intensive tagging programs. The results also have implications for the genetic control of migration and salmon's ability to respond to climate change.},

For consistency, our analyses primarily used coded wire tag-based (CWT) SAR estimates. Survival collapsed over the past half century by roughly a factor of three to ca. 1\% for many regions. Within the Columbia River, the SARs of Snake River populations, often singled out as exemplars of poor survival, are unexceptional and in fact higher than estimates reported from many other regions of the west coast lacking dams. Given the seemingly congruent decline in SARs to similar levels, the notion that contemporary survival is driven primarily by broader oceanic factors rather than local factors should be considered. Ambitious Columbia River rebuilding targets may be unachievable because other regions with nearly pristine freshwater conditions, such as SE Alaska and northern BC, also largely fail to reach these levels. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag-based SAR estimates available for Columbia River Basin populations are generally consistent with CWT findings; however, PIT tag-based SARs are not adjusted for harvest which compromises their intended use because harvest rates are large and variable. More attention is needed on how SARs should be quantified and how rebuilding targets are defined. We call for a systematic review by funding agencies to assess consistency and comparability of the SAR data generated and to further assess the implications of survival falling to similar levels in most regions of the west coast.},

Although piscivorous killer whales rely on echolocation to locate and track prey, the relationship between echolocation, movement, and prey capture during foraging by wild individuals is poorly understood. We used acoustic biologging tags to relate echolocation behavior to prey pursuit and capture during successful feeding dives by fish-eating killer whales in coastal British Columbia, Canada. The significantly higher incidence and rate of echolocation prior to fish captures compared to afterward confirms its importance in prey detection and tracking. Extremely rapid click sequences (buzzes) were produced before or concurrent with captures of salmon at depths typically exceeding 50\,m, and were likely used by killer whales for close-range prey targeting, as in other odontocetes. Distinctive crunching and tearing sounds indicative of prey-handling behavior occurred at relatively shallow depths following fish captures, matching concurrent observations that whales surfaced with fish prior to consumption and often shared prey. Buzzes and prey-handling sounds are potentially useful acoustic signals for estimating foraging efficiency and determining if resident killer whales are meeting their energetic requirements.},

  abstract = {Background: We sought to quantitatively describe the fine-scale foraging behavior of northern resident killer whales (Orcinus orca), a population of fish-eating killer whales that feeds almost exclusively on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). To reconstruct the underwater movements of these specialist predators, we deployed 34 biologging Dtags on 32 individuals and collected high-resolution, three-dimensional accelerometry and acoustic data. We used the resulting dive paths to compare killer whale foraging behavior to the distributions of different salmonid prey species. Understanding the foraging movements of these threatened predators is important from a conservation standpoint, since prey availability has been identified as a limiting factor in their population dynamics and recovery. Results: Three-dimensional dive tracks indicated that foraging (N = 701) and non-foraging dives (N = 10,618) were kinematically distinct (Wilks' lambda: {$\lambda$}16 = 0.321, P {$<$} 0.001). While foraging, killer whales dove deeper, remained submerged longer, swam faster, increased their dive path tortuosity, and rolled their bodies to a greater extent than during other activities. Maximum foraging dive depths reflected the deeper vertical distribution of Chinook (compared to other salmonids) and the tendency of Pacific salmon to evade predators by diving steeply. Kinematic characteristics of prey pursuit by resident killer whales also revealed several other escape strategies employed by salmon attempting to avoid predation, including increased swimming speeds and evasive maneuvering. Conclusions: High-resolution dive tracks reconstructed using data collected by multi-sensor accelerometer tags found that movements by resident killer whales relate significantly to the vertical distributions and escape responses of their primary prey, Pacific salmon.},
