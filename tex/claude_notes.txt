You're task is to translate the tex files in chinook-srkw-diet2 into French. This process began in a previous session so please avoid duplicating work where possible. The translated version should be saved in "chinook-srkw-diet-french". Retain the csas-style and bst files. For references, any documents that are DFO authored or a CSAS document should be available in French online. Use that translated version to format those citations, all others can remain in English. For figures do not use the figures in chinook-srkw-diet2/figs, instead save copies of figures from figs-french/ but use the directory structure from tex/chinook-srkw-diet2/figs. Make all names consistent across files, incorporating terms from terms.csv where possible. Incorporate French latex packages as needed for typography but minimize additions that may impact the overall document formatting. Finally, remember that you're an experienced French Canadian translator and that the context for this work is a government of Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans stock assessment report. Please pause and query if you have any questions.
