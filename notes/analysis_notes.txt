Notes for Chinook availability project

- Considerable variation in stock composition among areas within region, as well as variation in temporal sampling coverage (see figs/data_coverage/ directory). Ideally model with hierarchical GAMs. Alternatively consider restratifying to "subregions" using cluster analysis.
- Coverage at beginning/end of the year very sparse; consider truncating to March-Sep for SSoG and JdFS if convergence issues pronounced
- Issues with estimating abundance at year end; restrict catch data to be only in peak periods (non-cyclic); similarly for GSI, fit model to full dataset but constrain predictions to months with catch data

- Why does fit random = FALSE still produce interannual variability in predictions?
- Switch model from summing aggregates to flexibly producing predictions based on minimum scale of data (original is negbin_rsplines_dirichlet_mvn_cumsum)
- Issues with negbin component when generating area predictions


Feb. 18, 2022
-Confirmed negbin component functional with areas; bug due to double-logging predictions; remember moderate differences between mgcv expected due to RIs being fit!
