South Coast has collected a large number of genetic samples, but coverage varies among statistical subareas, months, and years. The following figure shows samples (up to 2020) constrained to Canadian subareas between Swiftsure and the Gulf Islands. Each point represents a single sampling event, defined here as fish sampled in a given week, year, and subarea. Larger points represent more samples, the points are colored based on catch regions, and shape represents whether the subarea overlaps with foraging area as defined by Joe's SRKW model.


By fitting a model to the raw stock composition data, we can account for sampling effort and generate predictions for strata where data are lacking. Basically the model assumes that subareas with more samples have more certainty, subareas within the same region are more similar to one another, that there is a smooth change in composition between months, and that data collected in a given year are correlated. 

The model can be used to generate a wide range of predictions based on how the data are binned and areas of interest, but will be constrained by data availability. For simplicity's sake I've focused on major management units, months where there are relatively large amounts of data, and subareas that overlap with RKW foraging areas. Like Joe's model, the predictions are for an "average" year, but depending on data availability we can generate annual predictions as well. Composition predictions can also be converted to stock-specific indices of abundance to identify seasonal changes in abundance. We can also make similar figures based on size distributions, not stock composition.

As you can see the predictions reflect some of the patterns Wilf described including the dominance of non-Canadian fish (particularly early in the year), the increasing abundance of WCVI fish late in the year nearshore (i.e. 21A), and the relative abundance of Summer 4.1 South Thompason fish near the Gulf Islands (i.e. 18B). Of interest to SEP may be the small contribution of Fraser Fall fish which includes Chilliwack, where substantial increases in production have been made.

As discussed, to provide greater granularity (below subarea or heatmaps) we could develop a distribution model based on georeferenced catches, but this would require a substantial increase in my time, a delay in delivery, or hiring a postdoc with a skillset similar to Joe Watson's to lead model development.





Outstanding questions
- Are estimates of stock-specific abundance relevant?
- Is ecological scale appropriate?
- Should interannual variability be included?
- Should it be extended to the Fraser?
